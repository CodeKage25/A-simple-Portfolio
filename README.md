# A-simple-Portfolio
AltSchool of Engineering First Semester Assignment 1
Objective: Build a simple HTML & CSS driven web application made up of a few linked pages and styled content
Create a HTML page with the following information: Home page which you will call About Me, contact page, register page and login page



The following should be included in your About Me page (which is your home page but will have the name About Me instead): 
Your name
A sentence about yourself
Your goal for this Diploma course
Education (list your past education and certificates)
Job experience
Hobbies & other skills


Create a Contact section within the page in step (1),  using a form with the below fields. The form should have a submit button and basic HTML validation
Name
Email
Message
Priority (dropdown)


Add a register page. It should have the below fields with HTML validation as well
First Name
Last Name
Phone 
Gender (dropdown)
Country
State/province
Username
Password
Confirm password







Add a Login page with a username field and a password field. Add basic HTML validation to the login form. It should have a submit button with the label of “Sign In”


Add a navigation menu at the top of the home page(About Me page). It should contain links to the sections within the page. Also, since you have 4 pages (the home page with your details, the contact page, the register page and the login page), add items to the menu that links the pages together so that there’s no dead end and you can always go from the home page to the others pages and then back to the home page

Create a Calculator page and create a calculator UI in it, using the HTML Table element. You will be back to make the calculator functional, but the goal for now is to make it look great, so apply what you have learnt about HTML & CSS. The Calculator should have:
A text field at the top
Numbers 0 to 9
Regular Maths operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%)


Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, add a photo of yourself


Bonus: Re-create the calculator UI in a new page, using CSS flexbox instead of using a table like earlier requested
